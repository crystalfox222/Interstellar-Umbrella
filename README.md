# Interstellar-Umbrella
A weather app that uses statistical forecasting to predict the weather on all planets within this solar system.

Welcome to Intersteller Umbrella, a weather app that uses statistical forecasting to predict the weather on all planets within this solar system. We will ensure that you are prepared for whatever storm the universe blows your way!

#DISCLAIMER: While real data is used in each prediction, the findings are not valid scientific data. This app is entirely theorhetical and should only be used for entertainment purposes.

#VARIABLES USED PLUS PURPOSE:
Axil Tilt: Main driver of seasons
Period: Time around the sun
Atmospheric composition: Measure chemical effects on weather
Surface composition: Measure chemical effects on weather and cycles
Core composition: Understand the stage the planet is at in its life
Distance from sun (au): Effects from temperature and radiation
Current sun weather: varying amounts of radiation and temp
Albedo: Percentage of reflected sunlight
Season: Location based on top down grid and ranges of x, y to know location in orbital period
Sunspots:
Solar flux:
Uv flux:
Cosmic ray flux:
